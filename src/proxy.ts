 * Runs before every page. Two jobs, in this order.
 *
 * The file used to be `middleware.ts` and the export used to be `middleware`.
 * Next 16 renamed the convention to `proxy` and deprecates the old name — the
 * behaviour is unchanged, and the rename is taken now rather than left to be
 * forced by 17. Everything below is the same code under a different name.
 *
 * First it refreshes the session. `getUser()` rather than `getSession()`: the
 * second one only decodes whatever cookie arrived, while the first verifies it
 * with the auth server and mints a new access token when the old one has
 * expired. Those new cookies are written onto `response` on the way past, which
 * is why the response has to be created before the client and returned after —
 * a fresh `NextResponse.next()` at the end would drop the refreshed session and
 * sign the learner out every hour.
 *
 * Then it protects the route. An unauthenticated request for a private page is
 * a redirect to `/login`, never a 401: a browser asking for a page should be
 * handed a page.
 *
 * API routes are deliberately outside the matcher. Their 401 is `withApi`'s,
 * and answering `fetch('/api/v1/me')` with a redirect to an HTML login page
 * gives the caller a 200 full of markup instead of an error it can branch on.
 * `/api/certificates/<code>/verify` is public for the same structural reason,
 * and
 * `/api/cron` authenticates with a bearer secret rather than a session.
