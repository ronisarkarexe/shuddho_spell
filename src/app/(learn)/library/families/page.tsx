/**
 * Word families — one root, the words English builds from it, and the rule.
 *
 * A **reference**, not a lesson. Nothing here is drilled, marked or seeded into
 * `words`: the 28-day course teaches 3,000 words and this holds 2,299 more,
 * chosen for the four IELTS papers. The two corpora are kept apart on purpose
 * — `content/word-families/schema.ts` sets out why — and the only bridge is the
 * `course` mark beside a word that appears in both.
 *
 * The first page is resolved on the server through the composition root, so the
 * cards are populated on first paint. Every filter and every page after that
 * comes from `/api/v1/library/families` — the same use case, reached the other
 * way.
