/**
 * The marketing landing page.
 *
 * A Server Component with **one** data read and no session: the demo's first
 * word, so the drill is playable on first paint. Everything else on the page is
 * literal or generated at authoring time from `syllabus.ts`.
 *
 * That one read is why the demo can draw from the real corpus without the
 * corpus reaching the browser. The landing page's budget is the reason it is a
 * word rather than a word list.
 *
 * `13-frontend.md` asks for it to be statically rendered and score ≥95
 * Lighthouse performance and 100 accessibility. What is under this file's
 * control is done: no images, no web fonts beyond the four the whole product
 * already loads, real headings in order, and every table a real table.
 *
 * **Five** client components now, not one: the signature flow, the dictation
 * demo, the alphabet strip, the letter families, and the gap-fill decoder.
 * That is a deliberate revision of the budget rather than a slip. The first
 * four are the same trade — a marketing page for a *pronunciation* course that
 * can only be read is describing the product instead of being it — and the
 * gap-fill section is the other half of the same claim: a course about
 * sentences whose landing page never lets a visitor *read a blank* is selling
 * the chart instead of being it. The two alphabet sections ship 26 rows of
 * text and a click handler between them, not a library. Four of the five share
 * `useSpeech`, so each after the first costs almost nothing; the decoder shares
 * none of that and is still cheap — a shuffle over a closed bank, no fetch.
 * The flow is the one real addition — it carries the microphone lifecycle —
 * and it is the section the page is now built around, so it earns it. **Static
 * rendering itself is blocked one level up** — the root layout calls
 * `getLocale()` and mounts `SessionBoundary`, both of which read cookies, and
 * a cookie read opts the whole tree into dynamic rendering. That is a Phase 1
 * and Phase 3 decision, not one this page can undo, and it is recorded rather
 * than worked around.
 *
 * The error table is the honest core of the pitch: eight mistakes Bengali
 * speakers actually make, named, with the reason. `07-speech-scoring.md` and
 * `content/phonemes.ts` are where each one comes from — none of it is invented
 * to sound persuasive.
