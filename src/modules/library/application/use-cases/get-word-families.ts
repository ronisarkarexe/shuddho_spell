 * much of English is in here" and "how much of it matches what I asked for". A
 * screen showing only the second reads as a much smaller product than it is;
 * one showing only the first cannot tell a learner that their filter found
 * nothing.
 *
 * **The topic index is always over the whole corpus.** It is navigation — a
 * list of doors — and a door that vanishes because the current filter excluded
 * it is a door the learner cannot find their way back through. This is the same
 * reasoning that keeps a disabled control on screen rather than removing it.
 *
 * One query, and only for the rule statements. The families themselves are a
