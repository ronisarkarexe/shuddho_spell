/**
 * The OpenAPI document, **generated from the request schemas the handlers
 * actually use**.
 *
 * `11-api-surface.md`: "OpenAPI is generated from the same Zod schemas and
 * served at `/api/v1/openapi.json`. It is documentation, not a second source of
 * truth." Every schema below is imported from the module that validates with
 * it — none is redeclared here. A hand-maintained document drifts from the API
 * the moment someone is in a hurry, and a drifted spec is worse than none
 * because people believe it.
 *
 * The **route list** is the one thing that cannot be derived from a schema, so
 * it is stated once here and checked against the filesystem by a sweep: a route
 * added under `src/app/api/v1/` and not registered fails the suite.
 *
 * It lives in `presentation`, not in `src/lib`, because it imports the request
 * DTOs — and `lib` may not import `presentation`. That is the boundary working:
 * the generator belongs beside the schemas it describes.
 *
 * No `server-only`, deliberately. This is a pure function over Zod schemas —
 * no secret, no client, no database — and marking it server-only would be a
 * claim about danger that is not there. The handler that serves it is
 * server-only through `withApi`, which is where the guard belongs.
