/**
 * The rail, in the order a learner meets these screens: today's work, the plan,
 * the drills, the weaknesses, the reference, the record, the exams.
 *
 * `/grammar` sits after `/weak-spots` and before the two word lists: it is a
 * course of its own — read in order, day by day — rather than a reference, and
 * a learner looking for "what do I study next" should meet it before they meet
 * a list of 3,000 words.
 *
 * `/words` sits before `/library` on purpose: they are both lists of words and
 * the difference is whose. A learner looking for "the word I kept getting
 * wrong" wants their own list, and finding the whole 3,000-word library first
 * is the wrong answer arriving before the right one.
 *
 * `/library/families`, `/library/vocabulary`, `/library/saifurs`,
 * `/library/formal-informal`,
 * `/library/verbs`, `/library/prepositions`, `/library/questions` and
 * `/library/patterns` sit
 * directly under `/library` because they are the same shelf: all of them are
 * reference rather than course. Vocabulary and Saifur's come first of the named
 * lists because a learner arrives knowing they want a better word, or the
 * admission-book list they already know by name; the preposition, question-word and gap-fill lists sit
 * after them as the closed charts looked up the same way. `activeHref` matches
 * the longest prefix, so standing on the families screen lights the families
 * item and not its parent — which is what makes nested items safe to list.
 *
 * The hrefs point at routes Phase 11 and Phase 12 build. That is deliberate and
 * is not scaffolding ahead: a navigation rail with no destinations is not the
 * feature. Nothing here creates a stub page — an unbuilt route 404s honestly
 * until its own feature lands.
